# wspr-tools
Code for the WSPR protocol

## encode.py

```python3 encode.py callsign locator power```

Currently only simple callsigns and 4-symbol locators are accepted. Power is
in dBm.

## arduino_ad9851.ino

Arduino program to actually transmit the data generated by `encode.py` using
an AD9851 module.

**Note**: if you use the square wave output (QOUT1 or its inverse QOUT2),
make sure to tune the comparator voltage to achieve a reasonable duty cycle.
If followed by a class E amplifier this is about 45% for maximum power output
(anywhere near 50% should be OK). I use a DC voltmeter and approximate the
duty cycle with V/5, so that a measured 2V reading translates into a 40% duty
cycle.

You could of course also take either of the sine wave outputs (ZOUT1, ZOUT2)
and amplify or feed directly into a low-pass filter to the antenna.
